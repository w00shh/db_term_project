## Additional Description

If program runs and user login, JDBC checks the list of selling items.

And if some item exceeded bid ending date, update it to sold item.

```java
public static void Check_End_Bid(Connection conn, Scanner sc) throws SQLException{
    	LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
    	DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
    	String formatedNow = now.format(formatter);
    	
        PreparedStatement pStmt = conn.prepareStatement("select * from item natural join selling_item where Bid_Ending_Date < ?");    	
        pStmt.setString(1,formatedNow);
        ResultSet rs = pStmt.executeQuery();                

        while(rs.next()) {    		
    		pStmt.clearParameters();
    		pStmt = conn.prepareStatement("insert into sold_item(Description,Sold_Price,Buyer) values(?,?,?)");
    		pStmt.setString(1, rs.getString("Description"));
    		pStmt.setInt(2, rs.getInt("Bidding_Price"));
    		pStmt.setString(3,rs.getString("Bidder"));
    		pStmt.executeUpdate();
    		
    		pStmt.clearParameters();
    		pStmt = conn.prepareStatement("update item set status='Sold' where Description = ?");
    		pStmt.setString(1, rs.getString("Description"));
    		pStmt.executeUpdate();
    		
        }
		pStmt.close();    	
    	return;
    }
```

âž•Additional Comment
As my program check set dates (ex. date_posted, Post_date) when user insert on sql. so my example table looks they were all transfered in same time because I used trigger for the time handling.
But when user code with JDBC, itâ€™s fine. â‡’ In short, sample tablee transfered in same time and it is not error.

Also, as I used description for primary key and kind of ID because I donâ€™t really think there are no much duplicate name in reused auction. So, if user try to sell item with duplicated item description, program stops it.
